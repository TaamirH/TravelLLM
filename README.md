# Travel Assistant (Node.js + TypeScript)
**Key prompt engineering decisions:**
1. Created distinct response templates for simple vs complex queries - LLMs perform better with explicit structure rather than vague instructions
2. Used deterministic keyword matching instead of LLM classification for external API calls - Reliability, performance, and cost optimization
3. Built explicit context tracking for pronouns ("there", "it") and day-only queries - Natural conversation flow
4. Hallucination Prevention both in SystemPrompt and in pattern detection with autofix
5. Chain-of-Though - Plan to Reccomendation with reasoning proccess , that helps the user understand the "why"
6. Error Handling in various places , makes sure we dont hallucinate and make up cities or weather data , ask for clarification instead of guessing

YOU:
plan 5 days holiday in tel aviv

TRAVELGENIE:

Plan:
1. Best time to visit Tel Aviv is spring (March-May), summer (June-August) for beach activities, but shoulder season like April or May offers pleasant weather and fewer tourists.
2. This period includes both holidays like Purim in March, attracting visitors with cultural events, and festivals like the Festival of Lights in October, which may coincide with your trip depending on exact dates.
3. Tel Aviv is known for its beach culture, but combining relaxation with explorations of museums like Eretz Israel or the White City architectural landmarks provides a balanced experience.
4. Considering budget, expect to spend around $150-200 per day, taking into account accommodations, food, and activities.

Recommendation:

TL;DR: Five days exploring Tel Aviv's beaches, markets, and culture.
• Day 1: Arrive in early afternoon, explore the beachfront promenade, and walk through local neighborhoods like Gordon or Rothschild Boulevard for a taste of Tel Aviv's lifestyle.

• Day 2: Spend morning at Carmel Market for the full sensory experience with food stalls, souvenirs, and people-watching. Afternoon can be spent relaxing at nearby Gordon Beach or exploring one of the local parks.

• Day 3: Head to Old Jaffa (Yafa) for its historic charm, old markets like Cario's and Flea Market in Neve Tzedek. Explore its quaint streets and port area.

• Day 4: Allocate day for museums - Eretz Israel, White City Architectural Museum offer a deep dive into Tel Aviv's origins and architectural heritage. Visit Sarona Market food hall for upscale dining experiences.

• Day 5: Take a day trip (about an hour away) to Caesarea ancient port city or opt for a quick hike in the Carmel Mountains for diverse landscapes.

Consider booking your accommodations well in advance due to possible holiday events or crowds that might make popular areas busier than usual.

YOU: what will the weather be like there in 2 weeks?

TRAVELGENIE:
I can only provide weather forecasts up to 5 days ahead. A forecast for 14 days from now would be beyond my reliable range.

For planning purposes, Tokyo in mid-September typically sees:
- Average temperatures of 20-26°C
- Occasional rain (September is part of the rainy season)
- Humidity levels around 70-80%

I recommend checking weather forecasts closer to your travel date for accurate information.
